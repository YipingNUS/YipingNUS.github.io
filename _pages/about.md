**NEWS:** we're hiring senior/lead scientists (NLP/data science) and multiple interns in HCMC, BKK or Pune. You can drop me an email with your CV if you're interested.

I work as a staff research scientist at [Knorex](https://www.knorex.com/) since Sep 2015. My research focus is the applications of natural language processing to the domain of computational advertising. Prior to joining Knorex, I conducted research into NLP at Baidu-I2R Research Centre under the supervision of Dr. [Su Jian](http://www.colips.org/~sujian/). 

I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D at Chulalongkorn University. I received my B.COMP (1st Class Honours) from National University of Singapore (supervised by Associate Prof. [Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/index.html))  and M.S from Chulalongkorn University (working with Asst. Prof. [Dittaya Wanvarie](http://pioneer.netserv.chula.ac.th/~wdittaya/)).

I'm no longer using any social media (e.g. LinkedIn, Facebook). If you want to reach out to me, please drop me an email.

Research Interests
======

I'm broadly interested in the applications of natural language processing. My current focus is dataless classification (aka. lightly-supervised learning, zero-shot learning, semi-supervised learning) where we induce classifiers without any labelled document ([Jin et al. 2017](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/I17-1055.pdf), [Charoenphakdee et al. 2019](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1411.pdf), [Jin et al. 2020](https://yipingnus.github.io/publication/2020-10-18-paper-title-number-5)). 

I also started working on natural language generation for online advertising recently. Our first work is on generating slogans with seq2seq transformers ([Jin et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05924))
