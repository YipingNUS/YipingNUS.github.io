I work as a senior research scientist at [Knorex](https://www.knorex.com/) (Singapore) since Sep 2015. My research focus is on the intersection between natural language processing and computational advertising. I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D at Chulalongkorn University. I received my B.COMP (1st Class Honours) from National University of Singapore and M.S from Chulalongkorn University.
