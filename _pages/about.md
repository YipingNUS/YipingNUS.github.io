I worked as Head of R&D at [Knorex](https://www.knorex.com/) from 2015 till 2021. My research interests include information retrieval, text mining, and natural language generation. Prior to joining Knorex, I worked as a researcher at Baidu-I2R Research Centre under the supervision of Dr. [Su Jian](http://www.colips.org/~sujian/) mainly on information extraction projects. 

I received B.COMP (1st Class Honours) from the National University of Singapore (supervised by Associate Prof. [Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/index.html)) and M.S & Ph.D from Chulalongkorn University.

Please feel free to contact me about any synergies between your research interests and mine. I'm no longer using any social media. If you want to reach out to me, please drop me an email.

Research Interests
======

I'm broadly interested in the applications of natural language processing. My current focus is weakly-supervised text classification (aka. dataless classification) where we induce classifiers without any manually-labelled document ([Jin et al. 2017](https://aclanthology.org/I17-1055/), [Charoenphakdee et al. 2019](https://aclanthology.org/D19-1411/), [Jin et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1351324920000340), [Jin et al. 2021a](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-srw.14/), [Jin et al. 2021b](https://aclanthology.org/2021.textgraphs-1.1/)). 

I'm also keen on natural language generation, especially controlling the topic, style, and content of generated texts without additional supervision ([Jin and Le, 2016](https://aclanthology.org/W16-6623/), [Jin et al. 2021](https://yipingnus.github.io/files/nle2021.pdf), [Jin et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03021)).
