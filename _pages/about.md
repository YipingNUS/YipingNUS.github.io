**NEWS:** I'm hiring NLP researchers, data scientists, ML engineers and interns in SG, HCMC, BKK or Pune. You can drop me an email with your CV if you're interested.

I work as the head of R\&D at [Knorex](https://www.knorex.com/). My research interests include weakly-supervised text classification, language generation, and information extraction. Prior to joining Knorex, I conducted research into NLP at Baidu-I2R Research Centre under the supervision of Dr. [Su Jian](http://www.colips.org/~sujian/). 

I received my B.COMP (1st Class Honours) from National University of Singapore (supervised by Associate Prof. [Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/index.html))  and M.S from Chulalongkorn University.

Please feel free to contact me about any synergies between your research interests and mine. I'm no longer using any social media. If you want to reach out to me, please drop me an email.

Research Interests
======

I'm broadly interested in the applications of natural language processing. My current focus is weakly-supervised text classification (aka. dataless classification) where we induce classifiers without any manually-labelled document ([Jin et al. 2017](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/I17-1055.pdf), [Charoenphakdee et al. 2019](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1411.pdf), [Jin et al. 2020](https://yipingnus.github.io/publication/2020-10-18-paper-title-number-5), [Jin et al. 2021a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09765), [Jin et al. 2021b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06429)). 

I work on natural language generation for online advertising since recently ([Jin et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05924)).
